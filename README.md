## Configuration and Running of Juma

How to configure and run Juma:
1. Extract Juma to desired directory.

2. You need to specify connection details to mysql server for Juma.
   Open the "../JUMA/juma-uplift-master/src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml" file and specify your mysql connection url, username and password.
	 
3. To add users for Juma, edit the "../JUMA/juma-uplift-master/src/main/resources/shiro-users.properties" file.
   Each user must be on a separate line and the syntax to declare a new use is as follows: "user.name = password".
	 So for a user "foo" with password "bar" it would be specified as: "user.foo = bar".
	 
4. To Run Juma, navigate to "../JUMA/juma-uplift-master".
	 Run the following command: "mvn jetty:run", this will run Juma on the default port which is 8080.
	 To run Juma on a specific port, run the following command instead: "mvn jetty:run -Djetty.port=xxxx".

5. In a web browser, go to http://localhost:8080 (or to whatever port you specified).
